This is an indivudal project done in my COP 3223: Introduction to Programming in C. 

Project Description : Primitive data type variables, arrays, user-defined functions, and C library functions will all be used in this project.

Project about : Test your code-cracking skills with Mastermind, a challenging game of deduction and reasoning. Can you solve the code in ten moves or less? 
Can you create an unbreakable code? With over 2,000 possible combinations, it's easy to learn and quick to play, offering a new challenge every time. 
The Codebreaker uses reasoning, inference, and a bit of luck to match the secret code set by the Codemaker, who provides hints after each move.
